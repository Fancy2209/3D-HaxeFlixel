## Info üîµ
This uses the [Away3D](https://github.com/openfl/away3d) frame work from OpenFL and makes it renderable in [HaxeFlixel](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel) as a FlxSprite. With some rendering workarounds in the FlxView3D and Main File, this is possible.

[Away3D](https://github.com/openfl/away3d) uses View3D as its primary container so that is what the FlxView3D works with. 

There is a planned implemanation of [Away3D](https://github.com/openfl/away3d) using a more HaxeFlixel like syntax to make the coder easier to work with.

## Limitations üî¥
- Can not render a model with more then **ONE** texture (can have specular and normal maps).
- Only supports the follow file formats; `.obj, .awd, .3ds, .ac3d, .md2, .md5, .dae, .dfx`.
- Amount of View3Ds allowed limited to `FlxG.stage.stage3Ds.length` (preformance dependent in some cases). Use `Flx3DUtil.is3DAvailable();` to check if a 3D Instance is available.

## Requirements üü°
- git (to install the latest version of Away3D as HaxeLib is outdated)
- The Away3D OpenFL Library; ` openfl git away3d https://github.com/openfl/away3d.git`
- Adding the Library to your Project.xml; `<haxelib name="away3d"/>`
